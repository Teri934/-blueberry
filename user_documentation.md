## Access old data on new phone

The generated file database.xml (see Settings "Generate and download results" button) is stored in Downloads folder. You need to transfer the file to your new phone. Then when it is in Downloads folder the old data can be accessed and seen in My Scores (see Settings "Synchronize your results" button). Then don't forget to remove the file Downloads folder because when clicking the button later again your new progress will be lost!
